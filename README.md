# Badgercopter

In this project, we try to build a ROS enabled quadcopter that is able to achieve vision based precise landing on a moving ground platform. In the end we realized vision based localization of ground platform, and tracking of ground platform in reality by simulation using high level control. In the documentation below, we will give an introduction about the structure of the system and how to repeat the result.
